## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 1. Hugging Face Interface (`app/hugging_face_script.py`)

**New Features Added:**
- ✅ **Appointment ID Input Field**: Automatically populated from URL parameters
- ✅ **End Consultation Button**: Prominent red button for completing appointments
- ✅ **JavaScript Integration**: Handles URL parameter extraction and API calls
- ✅ **Success/Error Handling**: User-friendly messages and status updates
- ✅ **Redirect Functionality**: Button to return to doctors page

**Key Code Sections:**
```python
# Appointment ID input
appointment_id_input = gr.Textbox(
    label="Appointment ID",
    placeholder="Enter your appointment ID here...",
    info="This will be automatically populated if you came from the doctors page"
)

# End Consultation button
end_consultation_btn = gr.Button(
    "End Consultation", 
    variant="stop", 
    size="lg",
    elem_classes=["end-consultation-btn"]
)

# JavaScript for URL parameter handling
def populateAppointmentId():
    var appointmentId = getUrlParameter('appointment_id');
    if (appointmentId) {
        // Populate the input field
    }
}
```

### 2. Flask Backend (`app/routes.py`)

**Existing Endpoints Used:**
- ✅ `/complete_appointment` (POST): Marks appointment as completed
- ✅ `/validate_appointment` (POST): Redirects to Hugging Face with appointment_id

**Database Operations:**
- Moves appointment from `appointments` to `completed_appointments` collection
- Updates appointment status to 'completed'
- Adds completion timestamp

### 3. Frontend Integration (`templates/doctors.html`)

**Existing Features:**
- ✅ Appointment booking form
- ✅ Appointment validation interface
- ✅ Display of active and completed appointments
